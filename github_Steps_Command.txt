Step-6: How to Make Branches, And How to Merge the Branch Project into Master Project/Head project.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Branch is just a clone of your master data. 
If 2 or more Developer is working on same Major project, For example:- The project name is  FaceChat.
FaceChat have 2 bug issues/or new updates, So we need to fix it, Firstly I am Making the Branch of FaceChat Named FaceChat v2.0. So, my major/master project is not affected during changes/updation.
Developer is changing/updating the data in FaceChat v2.0,If FaceChat v2.0 is successfull. Then, we have to merge the new version's data on Master Project/ Head Project.

1. $git branch
//Check The Branches


2.$git  branch "Branch Name"
// create a branch, Ex: $git branch FaceChat v2.0
FaceChat v2.0 is created 

3. $git checkout FaceChat v2.0
//switched to new branch

4. $git branch
// Now you can see you are under new branch named FaceChat v2.0

5. $git ls
//Show the all files in the projects

If we have to add some files on the project,file name index.js or index.css,
so, what we do... 

6. $ git status
//showing track or untracked files

7. $git add -A
//Add untraked files

8. $ git commit -m "Adding Index.js or Index.css file"
//Snapshot complete

9. $ git push origin master
//push the changes on github.



Now We have to MERGE/PUT the files from FaceChat v2.0  (Branch Project) to FaceChat  (Master Project)

1. $git checkout master
//checkout command is used for navigate each-other master to branches/ or branch to master
now we have the access in master file(FaceChat)

2. $git merge FaceChat v2.0
// now, your FaceChat v2.0 file is merged to FaceChat.

3. $ git status

4. $ git commit -m "Merged the FaceChat v2.0" 
//optional

5. $ git push origin master
//optional

Step-7: git log Command
___________________________________________________________________________

Log Command is used for check the all Logs Deatil about the Project. like:- Author, create, date, time, 
implement, add, update, delete, merge, branch, etc......

1. $git log
// Track all the details  about projects.

2. $git log -2
// track the last 2 details about projects
Ex:- $git log -5 > track the last 5 details about projects

3. $ git log --oneline
// track the details in one line

4. $git log -i
//-i is used for ignore case sensitive

6. $git log -i --grep = "Search"
// track the file named "Search", and -i is used for ignore case sensetive

7. $git log -p --grep = "search"
//  -p is used for check the code section.
